This is the Twitter Listener that is being implemented as a Windows Service
This is not fully functional just yet, but the process is going well.
The Twitter Listener Utilizes the SuperCSV created by the sentimentanalyzer. 
The listener searches for all stocks on the csv preceeded by "$", a common way to denote that a stock is referenced.
Collected Tweets are stored in a csv file
